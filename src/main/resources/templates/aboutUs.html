            <p>By capturing student imaginations and igniting career aspirations,

                careers in science, technology, engineering and math.
                We tie school to work by reinforcing basic skills and demonstrating
                how they are applied in STEM careers.  On Edheads' site, students
                can be surgeons, manufacturing technicians, find simple machines,
                predict the weather, create a stem cell line and more!

            <p>Gail Wheatley, Executive Director</p>
                <p>Gail has a passion for fun and informal education and a
                great deal of experience in informal learning institutions
                and science education. She brainstorms ideas with Eric, e
                stablishes partnerships with scientists, surgeons and people
                and corporations that do interesting things. Gail writes the
                grants and the storyboards for the activities, manages the projects
                overall, crunches lots of numbers and does the long term planning
                for Edheads. She's always on the lookout for great new ideas and
                people who have them. She lives with two monster Westies
                (no, that is not an oxymoron) whose current science experiment is
                    determining how many times they can dig up an apple tree before killing it.</p>
